                <br>
                <p class="new">After pursuing a super stressful career path in business development for far too long, finally, five
                    months ago, I</p>
                <p class="new">decided to make a U-turn and come up with an escape plan.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="new">The plan focused on combining my education in industrial product design, experience in b2b customer
                    relations, and
                    hobbies for books and languages into a new career path that I would enjoy and have the opportunity to
                    grow in - most
                    importantly, I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it, that I'm the master of my destiny.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p class="new">Currently, I'm working towards becoming a junior front-end developer. In an ever-expanding digital
                    environment, my
                    goal is to build websites that are profitable for businesses and satisfying for their customers.</p>
